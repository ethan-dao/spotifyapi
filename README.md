# spotifyapi
Project using Python and machine learning algorithms to create additional song recommendations based off a playlist. I gathered Spotify data from over 1,000 official Spotify playlists, creating a CSV file of over 100,000 songs and their audio features. I then used a cosine similarity algorithm to gauge how similar songs were to each other based on these features, and used this method to recommend songs based on a string of songs from a playlist. The recommendation system is still in progress and includes some filler code, but I am working on improving the cosine similarity algorithm as well as testing other algorithms, such as linear regression, on the song data.
